# 🎯 MASTER PLAN - Qwenticinicial Development Roadmap

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Read this file FIRST in every new AI session**

---

## 📖 Essential Reading (In Order)

1. **VISION.md** - Understand the n8n-style autonomous orchestration architecture
2. **replit.md** - Current implementation status and technical details
3. **CONSOLIDATION_BLUEPRINT.md** - Complete file structure and integration guide
4. **This file (MASTER_PLAN.md)** - Current progress and next steps

---

## 🎯 The TRUE Vision

**Qwenticinicial is NOT a chat app.** It's an **n8n-style autonomous multi-agent orchestration platform** where:

1. **Master Orchestrator** analyzes user requests
2. Creates **execution plans**
3. **Delegates to specialist agents** (parallel execution)
4. Agents work **autonomously** with their tools
5. Results **compiled automatically**
6. Visual dashboard shows **real-time orchestration**

**Success = User submits ONE request → Multiple agents execute autonomously → Complete answer delivered**

---

## ✅ Current Implementation Status

### **Core Infrastructure (Complete)**
- ✅ 5 AI Agents: Learning Coach, Research Agent, Task Manager, Teaching Assistant, Head Coordinator
- ✅ Master Orchestrator (`server/masterOrchestrator.ts`)
- ✅ Agent routing & coordination (`server/agentCoordinator.ts`)
- ✅ Cross-conversation memory system
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with 19 tables
- ✅ Tier system (FREE/PRO/PREMIUM) infrastructure
- ✅ Authentication (Replit Auth)
- ✅ Mobile-responsive UI

### **Features Working**
- ✅ Multi-agent chat interface
- ✅ Keyword-based agent routing
- ✅ Streaming AI responses
- ✅ Tasks, Meetings, Schedules management
- ✅ User memory across conversations
- ✅ Agent interaction logging
- ✅ Admin dashboard

### **CRM System (90% Complete)**
- ✅ Database: 5 tables (companies, contacts, projects, communications, research)
- ✅ Backend: 30+ API endpoints with full CRUD
- ✅ Storage layer: 25+ database methods
- ✅ Frontend: Dashboard with read/delete functionality
- ⚠️ **MISSING: Create/Edit forms** (architect flagged this - IN PROGRESS)

---

## 🚧 Current Priority (DO THIS FIRST)

### **1. Complete CRM Forms (URGENT)**
**File:** `client/src/pages/CRM.tsx`

**Problem:** All "Add..." buttons exist but have NO onClick handlers or forms. No way to create/update entities.

**Fix Required:**
- [ ] Add dialog state for each entity type (companies, contacts, projects, communications, research)
- [ ] Create forms with proper fields and validation
- [ ] Wire up create mutations (POST requests)
- [ ] Wire up edit mutations (PATCH requests)
- [ ] Add success/error handling
- [ ] Test full CRUD flow

**Expected Outcome:** Users can create, read, update, delete all CRM entities through the UI.

---

## 🎯 Phase 2: Visual Orchestration Dashboard (NEXT)

### **Goal:** Show users their AI army at work

**What to Build:**
1. **Real-time Orchestration View** (`/orchestrate`)
   - Current: Basic interface exists
   - Needed: Visual workflow showing agent delegation
   - Display: Which agents are active, what they're working on
   - Progress: Real-time status updates

2. **Agent Status Cards**
   - Show: Active/Idle status for each agent
   - Display: Current tasks assigned
   - Log: Recent completions

3. **Execution Timeline**
   - Visual: Request → Analysis → Delegation → Execution → Results
   - Real-time: Stream updates as agents work
   - History: Past orchestrations

**Files to Modify:**
- `client/src/pages/Orchestration.tsx` - Enhance with visual workflow
- `server/masterOrchestrator.ts` - Add status streaming
- `shared/schema.ts` - Add orchestration_status table if needed

---

## 🎯 Phase 3: Autonomous Multi-Step Workflows

### **Goal:** Agents work without user intervention

**What to Build:**
1. **Task Chaining**
   - Master creates multi-step plans
   - Agents execute sequentially or in parallel
   - Results feed into next agent's context

2. **Self-Organizing Behavior**
   - Agents can create sub-tasks for other agents
   - Automatic retry/fallback on failure
   - Smart dependency resolution

3. **Background Execution**
   - "Fire & forget" mode for long-running tasks
   - Notify user when complete
   - Results stored in database

**Implementation:**
- Enhance `server/masterOrchestrator.ts` with workflow engine
- Add task dependency graph
- Implement agent-to-agent communication protocol

---

## 🎯 Phase 4: Premium Features (Future)

### **Tier-Gated Capabilities**

**Pro Tier ($20/month):**
- Unlimited messages
- Advanced multi-step orchestration
- Custom agent configurations
- Enhanced memory capacity

**Premium Tier ($50/month):**
- Video Creator Agent (automated video generation)
- YouTube Agent (content planning, scripting)
- Movie Maker Agent (multi-scene compilation)
- Extended API integrations (Gmail, Calendar, Notion)

**Files to Configure:**
- `server/tierConfig.ts` - Define feature gates
- `shared/schema.ts` - Add premium feature tracking
- Frontend: Add upgrade prompts and tier indicators

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Add data-testid to all interactive elements
- Validate inputs with Zod schemas
- Use TanStack Query for API calls
- Update replit.md after significant changes

### **Testing:**

- Test on mobile AND desktop
- Verify all CRUD operations work
- Check agent responses stream correctly

### **Before Completing:**

## 🚀 Success Metrics

**The system is working correctly when:**
- ✅ User submits ONE request
- ✅ Multiple agents execute WITHOUT user intervention
- ✅ Results compile automatically
- ✅ Visual dashboard shows orchestration
- ✅ Complete answer delivered

**NOT working if:**
- ❌ User manually selects agents
- ❌ Agents need step-by-step user input
- ❌ No autonomous execution
- ❌ No visual orchestration view

---

## 📋 Current Task List

1. **URGENT:** Complete CRM create/edit forms
2. Build visual orchestration dashboard
3. Implement autonomous multi-step workflows
4. Add agent-to-agent communication
5. Create background task execution
6. Build tier upgrade flow
7. Add premium features (video/multimedia agents)

---

## 💡 Key Principles

1. **Autonomous First** - Agents work without constant user input
2. **Visual Orchestration** - User sees the AI army at work
3. **Shared Intelligence** - All agents access same knowledge
4. **Self-Organizing** - Master orchestrates, specialists execute
5. **Scalable Architecture** - Ready for multimedia/advanced tools
