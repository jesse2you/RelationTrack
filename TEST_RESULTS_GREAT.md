## 📊 Architecture Confirmed

**YOU HAVE ONE CONSOLIDATED APPLICATION** ✓

Not 3 separate apps - everything works together:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   AI AGENT ROUTER (Port 5000)   │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Frontend (React)               │
│  Backend (Express + AI Routing) │
│  Database (PostgreSQL)          │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Components Working Together:
- **Frontend** (`client/`) - React chat interface
- **Backend** (`server/`) - Express API + AI routing logic  
- **Database** (`db/`) - PostgreSQL storage
- **Shared** (`shared/`) - Types used by both frontend and backend

**All parts run as ONE unified application on port 5000**
